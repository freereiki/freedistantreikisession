                <blockquote><strong>Probably you will think that is another scam. If someone would tell me this a few years ago, I should say the same.</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>The truth is that I begun to achieve this ReiKi Energy and I healed myself and others. The idea is that I found people who did not feel anything. No heat, nothing.</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>I tried to find a pattern and asked them questions to find why is this happenning, but without any result.</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>My conclusion is that there are persons who are more anchored in the reality. The life force is responsive to thoughts and feelings.</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>It becomes disrupted when we accept, either consciously or unconsciously, negative thoughts or feelings about ourselves.&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>These negative thoughts and feelings attach themselves to the energy field and cause a disruption in the flow of life force.&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>This diminishes the vital function of the organs and cells of the physical body.</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Reiki heals by flowing through the affected parts of the energy field and charging them with positive energy.</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>It raises the vibratory level of the energy field in and around the physical body where the negative thoughts and feelings are attached.This causes the negative energy to break apart and fall away.&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>In so doing, Reiki clears, straightens and heals the energy pathways, thus allowing the life force to flow in a healthy and natural way.</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>I continue to say that I am NOT a Healer.&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>What I am trying to do is to become a link or a channel between REIKI and yourself.</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>When you will take one of my free ReiKi healing sessions, I will send you REIKI and you will feel it as a heat in your palms. After you will feel it and only IF you will feel it, I will give you my permission to take REIKI thru me whenever and wherever you need.</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>You may use it for all kind of illnessses, anytime, anywhere.</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>How to use it? It is extremely simple but very powerful.</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>All you have to do is to keep your hands with your palms over the body painful area for as long as you can, until your pain vanishes.</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Position yourself in a way so that you can easily hold each hand position comfortably.&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>To do this you might find it helpful to relax in a comfortable chair or to lay on the floor or on a mat with a pillow.&nbsp;</strong><br></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Remember the important thing when doing Reiki is to be comfortable.&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Reiki has its own wisdom and knows where to go and what to treat.&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Reiki may also choose to flow to other areas of your body or energy field other than where your hands are placed.&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Begin by taking a moment to prepare yourself.&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>You can say a prayer or an affirmation stating that you're willing to be deeply healed asking that your Reiki energy be strong and effective and giving thanks for this moment in time in which you can relax and heal.&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Remember to keep your fingers together during your treatment to keep the Reiki energy more focused.&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>You have here a YouTube video on how to use REIKI:&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/W5HeyMeC468" target="_blank">YOUTUBE VIDEO&nbsp;</a></strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Your permission is to use it ONLY for yourself.&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>You cannot heal anyone else. For doing so, you have to become a real REIKI practitioner and follow some REIKI classes where you will be attuned.</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Here, I am able to helping you to receive REIKI thru me and use it for your own good, for free.</strong></blockquote>
